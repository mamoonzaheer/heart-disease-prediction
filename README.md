# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease using patient health data. It includes an end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing and model training to web deployment using Flask.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to assist medical professionals by providing a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease based on key health indicators.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Binary classification: Detect presence or absence of heart disease
- Data preprocessing pipeline using `scikit-learn`
- Trained model using Random Forest (99% accuracy)
- Flask web app with HTML frontend for user input and prediction
- Clean UI with immediate result display
- Ready-to-deploy structure
